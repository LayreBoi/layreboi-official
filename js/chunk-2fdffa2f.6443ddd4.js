After TTien63 told me what name I&#39;ve put, I got scared because I&#39;ve put my real name into the contributor list (songwriter), but she actually meant the artist name. After that scary time, my track got accidentally taken down by my request, while it was delivered to the stores, which was my &quot;worst mistake&quot;. I&#39;ve reuploaded my track to the distributor and it was approved again.</p></div>',7);Object(o["s"])();var r=d((function(t,a){return Object(o["r"])(),Object(o["e"])("div",s,[c])}));e("3fcf");const i={};i.render=r,i.__scopeId="data-v-58732cd6";a["default"]=i},"3fcf":function(t,a,e){"use strict";e("ec9a")},ec9a:function(t,a,e){}}]);
