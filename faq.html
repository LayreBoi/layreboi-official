			<h3>When did you start producing music?</h3>
			<h4>
			Since 2019. I've also been making music earlier, but it wasn't good, since it's not original, 
			just samples and crap, made with a simple app. When I installed FL Studio Mobile on my phone, 
			I started to try and figure it out myself how to produce music. My first tracks were crap, 
			which makes me instantly feel embarrassed after hearing my first sounds. Being way too lazy
			at mastering and equalizing instruments isn't good for producing good tracks.
			</h4>
			<h4>
			When I started uploading my tracks on YouTube, I started with the name <i>DylanTube</i>. Most 
			of my tracks there weren't popular and on other videos than music, I thought the editing was 
			too good for a non-popular channel, which doesn't help getting good audiences, so I stopped 
			uploading videos and started with a new channel called <i>LayreBoi</i> and this is where I
			started producing good tracks.
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="faqbox1">
			<h3>Why do you produce music?</h3>
			<h4>
			Because it's fun! I actually don't make music for money, I just do it for fun. My actual dream 
			job is to be a programmer or technician. Then why do I release them to stores? For people who
			may like to listen to my tracks outside YouTube.
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="faqbox2">
			<h3>What motivated you to produce music?</h3>
			<h4>
			I just like music, which is why I also play a lot of osu!.
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="faqbox1">
			<h3>What softwares do you use?</h3>
			<h4>
			FL Studio Mobile (Music), Kinemaster (Video editing), Avee player (Music visualizer) and 
			IbisPaint X (Arts)
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="faqbox2">
			<h3>Can I use your tracks in my contents (or games)?</h3>
			<h4>
			Of course! Just don't forget to credit the track and add a link to my channel (If you're 
			uploading your content containing my music on YouTube). ^^
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="faqbox1">
			<h3>Can I remix one of your songs?</h3>
			<h4>
			Sure! I would be excited listening to your remix!
			</h4>
			<h4>
			I'd also appreciate if you put a link to the original track after you release your remix
			on YouTube.
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="faqbox2">
			<h3>How old are you?</h3>
			<h4>
			I don't think that's important for now...
			</h4>
		</div>
		<div class="faqbox1">
