I've also been making music earlier, but it wasn't good, since it's not original, \r\n\t\t\tjust samples and crap, made with a simple app. When I installed FL Studio Mobile on my phone, \r\n\t\t\tI started to try and figure it out myself how to produce music. My first tracks were crap, \r\n\t\t\twhich makes me instantly feel embarrassed after hearing my first sounds. Being way too lazy\r\n\t\t\tat mastering and equalizing instruments isn't good for producing good tracks.\r\n\t\t\t</h4>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>\r\n\t\t\tWhen I started uploading my tracks on YouTube, I started with the name <i>DylanTube</i>. Most \r\n\t\t\tof my tracks there weren't popular and on other videos than music, I thought the editing was \r\n\t\t\ttoo good for a non-popular channel, which doesn't help getting good audiences, so I stopped \r\n\t\t\tuploading videos and started with a new channel called <i>LayreBoi</i> and this is where I\r\n\t\t\tstarted producing good tracks.\r\n\t\t\t</h4>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t\t<div class=\"faqbox1\">\r\n\t\t\t<h3>Why do you produce music?</h3>\r\n\t\t\t<h4>\r\n\t\t\tBecause it's fun!
