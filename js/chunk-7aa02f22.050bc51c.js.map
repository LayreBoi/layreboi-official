The music visualizer video took a long time to upload, due to multiple errors and retries... It was only available at YouTube and SoundCloud, until my friend, TTien63, teached me how to upload in Spotify.</p>\r\n\t\t\t<p>Through <a href=\"https://amuse.io\">Amuse</a>, a free distributor, I've successfully released my track on stores, but not that successfully at first. After TTien63 told me what name I've put, I got scared because I've put my real name into the contributor list (songwriter), but she actually meant the artist name. After that scary time, my track got accidentally taken down by my request, while it was delivered to the stores, which was my \"worst mistake\". I've reuploaded my track to the distributor and it was approved again.</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t</div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<style scoped>\r\n/** This is to avoid any vue warnings because of <center>. */\r\n\r\nh1{\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n}\r\np{\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n}\r\nh3{\r\n\ttext-align: center;\r\n}\r\n</style>","import { render } from \"./303473112020.vue?vue&type=template&id=2ffcfa18&scoped=true\"\nconst script = {}\n\nimport \"./303473112020.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=2ffcfa18&scoped=true&lang=css\"\nscript.render = render\nscript.__scopeId = \"data-v-2ffcfa18\"\n\nexport default script","export * from \"-!../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/stylePostLoader.js!../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader-v16/dist/index.js??ref--0-1!./303473112020.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=2ffcfa18&scoped=true&lang=css\""],"sourceRoot":""}
