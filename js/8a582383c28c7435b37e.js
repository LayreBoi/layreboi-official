I&#39;ve also been making music earlier, but it wasn&#39;t good, since it&#39;s not original, just samples and crap, made with a simple app. When I installed FL Studio Mobile on my phone, I started to try and figure it out myself how to produce music. My first tracks were crap, which makes me instantly feel embarrassed after hearing my first sounds. Being way too lazy at mastering and equalizing instruments isn&#39;t good for producing good tracks. </h4><h4 data-v-0025974d> When I started uploading my tracks on YouTube, I started with the name <i data-v-0025974d>DylanTube</i>. Most of my tracks there weren&#39;t popular and on other videos than music, I thought the editing was too good for a non-popular channel, which doesn&#39;t help getting good audiences, so I stopped uploading videos and started with a new channel called <i data-v-0025974d>LayreBoi</i> and this is where I started producing good tracks. </h4></div><div class="faqbox1" data-v-0025974d><h3 data-v-0025974d>Why do you produce music?</h3><h4 data-v-0025974d> Because it&#39;s fun! I actually don&#39;t make music for money, I just do it for fun. My actual dream job is to be a programmer or technician. Then why do I release them to stores?
